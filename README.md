Notifications for combat events you should probably know about.
What originally started as a rewrite to the original SpellNotifications by Veev morphed into this dual SpellNotification / SpellAlerter monstrosity I have now.

## Features

- **Interrupt Tracking**: Visual and audio notifications when you interrupt enemy spells

- **Dispel Tracking**: Alerts for successful dispels with spell information

- **Customizable Alerts**: Adjustable font, size, and sound effects

- **Configurable Filters**: Enable/disable specific spell tracking


## Commands

- `/bj config` - Open configuration panel
- `/bj debug` - Toggle debug messages
- `/bj test` - Test visual and sound alerts

## Requirements

- ***[!!!ClassicAPI](https://gitlab.com/Tsoukie/classicapi/-/tree/main?ref_type=heads)*** (eventually will be removed once I add proper fallbacks)
